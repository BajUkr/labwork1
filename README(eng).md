# Laboratory Work

This repository contains the implementation of the laboratory work performed by Yan Marchan. The project includes both a Python-based solution and an accompanying Excel spreadsheet that mirrors the calculations done in Python.

## Description

The intent of this laboratory work is to demonstrate the ability to translate complex calculations and algorithms from a Python codebase into an Excel format. This allows for a broader understanding of the computing processes involved and provides a visual and interactive way to explore the data and results.

## Structure

- `src/`: This directory contains the Python source code used for performing the calculations.
- `calculations.xlsx`: An Excel spreadsheet that includes the same calculations as in the Python scripts, allowing for a comparison between the two methods.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading that provides an overview of the project.

## Usage

To run the Python code, navigate to the `src/` directory and execute the scripts using a Python interpreter. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open the `calculations.xlsx` file in Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet application to view and interact with the calculations.
